## What are functions in Python?
In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It's like a little machine you can build to automate processes and solve problems.
Imagine a function as a recipe: you define the ingredients (parameters) and steps (function body), and the function gives you the final result (return value).

## Why use functions?

* Code reuse: Instead of repeating the same code over and over, you can create a function and call it when you need to.
* Modularity: Functions divide your program into smaller, more manageable parts, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
* Abstraction: Functions allow you to focus on what the function does without worrying about implementation details.
* Organization: Functions help organize your code, making it more readable and easier to debug.
